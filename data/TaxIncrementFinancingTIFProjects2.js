Brinshore-Michaels has successfully undertaken the redevelopment efforts at three additional former CHA public housing redevelopment sites - Henry Horner Homes, Robert Taylor Homes and Ogden-North (Lawndale Complex).  Additionally, the Michaels organization reports to have successfully developed over 31,000 housing units in 27 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Brinshore reports to have completed more than thirty tax credit funded projects, comprised of over 3,000 apartments and homes across the Midwest in Indianapolis, Indiana, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Fort Madison, Iowa, and the following cities located in Illinois: Bloomington, Champaign, Chicago, Galesurg, Highland Park, Joliet, Melrose Park, Naperville, Matoon, Rock Island, Rockford, and Urbana.  The requested HED financing for this project is $1,750,000 in 9% LIHTCs which will generate $16,973,303 in equity, $2,700,000 in TIF funding, a private first mortgage of $1,150,000, a CHA HOPE VI loan of $7,275,000, $328,558 in deferred developer fee and a $100 general partner equity contribution.  The total project cost is $28,426,960. \n \nThis project is part of the redevelopment of the CHA Rockwell Gardens public housing development.  The proposed redevelopment project is the new construction of 76 rental units, in seven (7) residential three-stsory walk-up buildings, built on land currently owned by the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA).  The project will consist of 25 CHA replacement units, 30 affordable units and 21 market-rate units.  The public housing units are intended to replace housing units demolished at the Maplewood Courts site and the former Rockwell Gardens, the CHA development immediately adjacent to the subject property.  Built in 1961 and located 3 miles west of Chicago's Central Business District, Rockwell Gardens originally consisted of 1,126 housing units.  Demolition of this development began in 2003 as this project is part of the CHA's Plan for Transformation.  In addition to the seven residential buildings, an accessory building will be built to house the management\/community center.  All buildings will be 100% masonry with a combination of brick with limestone accents.  There will be 20 one-bedroom units, 36 two-bedroom units, 18 three-bedroom units, and 2 four-bedroom units.  The site is bounded by Jackson Boulevard on the North, Maplewood Street (previously vacated but newly reconstruction) on the East, Van Buren Street on the South and Rockwell Street (vacated) on the West.  Buildings along Jackson, Van Buren and new Maplewood will face onto the streets.  The building along vacated Rockwell will face an internal &quot;plaza&quot; consisting of abundant landscaping and parking for the development.  The plaza will also house the management\/community center, a tot lot and passive open green space for the residents.  There will be sixty on-site parking spaces.","CDC DATE":"12\/09\/2014","APPROVED AMOUNT":"$2700000","TOTAL PROJECT COST":"$28426960","X COORDINATE":1159392.5066662061,"Y COORDINATE":1898418.3701004779,"LATITUDE":41.876981954999998,"LONGITUDE":-87.690222144000003,"LOCATION":"(41.876981954573225, -87.69022214432427)"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.690222144,41.876981955]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"ID":1644.0,"TIF DISTRICT":"Lawrence\/Kedzie","PROJECT NAME":"IGA - CBE - Peterson - ES - II","ADDRESS":"5510 N Christiana Av","DEVELOPER":"Chicago Board of Education","PROJECT ID":1026.0,"PROJECT DESCRIPTION":"Peterson School Project Associated with the New Addition.The facility will receive a new 26,094 sq. ft. addition containing 6 classrooms and a general purpose area I cafeteria.

A cornerstone of the development is the Homan Square Community Center, which houses a Chicago Park District pool and gym, as well as numerous social service agencies to serve area residents.   \n\nThe project architecture will be similar to previous phased, with brick on the 1st floor and siding on the upper floors.  Energy efficient features include high efficiency furnaces, air conditioning, and water heaters for each unit; Energy Star rated ceiling fans and lighting; low VOC paints, carpets, and pads, and low-flow kitchen and bath faucets and shower heads.\n\nThe project is located in PD 535, which (per the developer's attorney) already already allows the additional 52 units proposed for Phase VI. The approvals needed from zoning are site plan approval and then a Part II.  The developer will submit for site plan approval soon. The Part II will be accomplished when the building permit application is submitted.","CDC DATE":"09\/09\/2014","APPROVED AMOUNT":"$3062798","TOTAL PROJECT COST":"$13771430","X COORDINATE":1152417.1780591081,"Y COORDINATE":1895758.8687419239,"LATITUDE":41.869824559000001,"LONGITUDE":-87.715903846000003,"LOCATION":"(41.86982455944267, -87.71590384580168)"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.715903846,41.869824559]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"ID":1525.0,"TIF DISTRICT":"Central Loop","PROJECT NAME":"Reliance Bldg - IV - Hotel Burnham","ADDRESS":"37 N State St","DEVELOPER":"Canal Street Hotel Partners LP","PROJECT ID":667.0,"PROJECT DESCRIPTION":"Located in the Loop, the project includes restoration of an historic 14-story office building known as &quot;Reliance Building&quot; for use as Hotel Burnham and a restaurant.","CDC DATE":"12\/09\/1997","APPROVED AMOUNT":"$2458426","TOTAL PROJECT COST":"$21783426","X COORDINATE":1176397.8456447429,"Y COORDINATE":1900707.4310357231,"LATITUDE":41.882896643000002,"LONGITUDE":-87.62771498,"LOCATION":"(41.88289664333733, -87.6277149801555)"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.62771498,41.882896643]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"ID":1323.0,"TIF DISTRICT":"35th\/State","PROJECT NAME":"Stateway Gardens - Phase 1 - Park Blvd","ADDRESS":"3500 S State St","DEVELOPER":"Park Boulevard LLC","PROJECT ID":137.0,"PROJECT DESCRIPTION":"The project includes the redevelopment  of Stateway Gardens as a mixed-income community to be called Parkway Boulevard.
